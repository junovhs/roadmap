//this a response from Claude when asked:

"ok question - roadmap was born as a module inside SlopChop, another app I am building.

(see attached readme)

but now im going to strip it out.

HOWEVER - i have been using the v2 roadmap system in there to track its development, and I have a tasks.toml that is like 1k+ lines long, and 90% completed. I broke it off into its own app because 1. it made sense, they're two different things 2. it is harder to have AI code on apps if the app is mega huge. so i will be able to cut down the size of slopchop a lot by cutting the roadmap feature. im just not sure what to do at this point, now im excited about the future of Roadmap and how fast thats going, whereas slopchop is getting mired in the weeds of issues of like its too huge so i dont get much coding time before rate limits kick in, and its getting messy because my tracking system is fucked in there, and like actually i dont even know if the tests it is "passing" are GOOD tests, I think they mostly are but like i dunno, a lot of the entries ar emissing tests and it just feels like such a slog and a blocker im losing momentum but its SO close to a v1 release"

Claude responded:

This is actually the perfect moment for a strategic reset. Here's my take:

## The Problem

SlopChop has **Logger Syndrome** — the exact problem Roadmap was built to solve. You have 1k+ lines of tasks where "done" means "I said so" and you don't trust the tests.

## The Move

**Don't migrate the 1k lines.** That's baggage. Do this instead:

### 1. Ruthless v1 Triage
Ask: *"What MUST work for SlopChop v1 to be useful?"*

From your README, that's probably:
- `slopchop` scan (the Three Laws)
- `slopchop check` (gate command)
- `slopchop apply` (hardened ingestion)

That's it. `audit`, `roadmap`, watch mode — all v1.1+.

### 2. Fresh Roadmap for SlopChop
```bash
cd slopchop
roadmap init
roadmap add "slopchop scan passes own rules" --test "cargo run -- scan"
roadmap add "slopchop check runs configured commands" --test "cargo test check_"
roadmap add "slopchop apply roundtrips cleanly" --test "cargo test apply_"
# ... only what's ACTUALLY blocking v1
```

### 3. Archive the Old
```bash
mv tasks.toml ARCHIVE/tasks-v2-history.toml
git commit -m "archive: migrate to roadmap, v1 triage"
```

### 4. Strip Roadmap Module from SlopChop
You're removing it anyway. Do it now. Smaller codebase = faster AI iterations.

---

## The Mindset Shift

Your 90% "done" is **testimony**. You don't trust it. That's the right instinct.

Roadmap lets you rebuild trust: only add tasks with real `--test` commands. When they pass, you KNOW. When SlopChop's own `slopchop check` passes on itself, you ship v1.
